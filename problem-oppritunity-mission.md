Things I like:
- Recording activities on my Garmin and all the data it provides
- Recording activities on Peloton bike and tread w/ out the Garmin.
- Engaging on the Strava community and taking advantage of their premium analysis 
- possibility of mergibg data files between Garmin and Peloton workouts to get a deeper workout analysis (cadence, ground contact time, breathing rate, etc)

Current scenarios
- Garmin can automaticly sync to Strava
- Peloton can automatically sync to Garmin (Peloton > Garmin > Strava)
- Peloton can sync with Strava
- we can use syncmyworkout to merge Peloton + Garmin data for a more accurate activity data.

Problem situations:
- when you simultaneously record a Peloton Tread Run and a Garmin Indoor run, syncmyworkout will create a merged File on Garmin. But when you initially save the ride, it gets automatically sent to Strava and when the activity is merged, it gets sent to Strava again. 
- currently all Garmin activities get sent to Strava, regardless of activity type or length.

solutions 
- take over managing the syncing between Garmin and Strava so we can refine what type of activities are public, private or sent at all. This avoids situations where I'm posting a bunch of walks, or stretching activities :)
- allow merging of Garmin data with overlapping Peloton workouts, when available.
